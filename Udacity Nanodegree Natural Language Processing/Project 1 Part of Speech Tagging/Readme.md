Project: Part of Speech Tagging

Course: Udacity Nanodegree Natural Language Processing

Project Submission: 16.01.2021

Outline:
In this notebook, you'll use the Pomegranate library to build a hidden Markov model for part of speech tagging using a "universal" tagset. Hidden Markov models have been able to achieve >96% tag accuracy with larger tagsets on realistic text corpora. Hidden Markov models have also been used for speech recognition and speech generation, machine translation, gene recognition for bioinformatics, and human gesture recognition for computer vision, and more.

Step 1: Review the provided interface to load and access the text corpus
Step 2: Build a Most Frequent Class tagger to use as a baseline
Step 3: Build an HMM Part of Speech tagger and compare to the MFC baseline
Step 4: (Optional) Improve the HMM tagger

Technqiues:
- Numpy
