Project: Image Classifier Project

Course: Udacity Nanodegree AI Programming with Python

Project Submission: 23.09.2018

Outline:
In this project, you'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers.
The project is broken down into multiple steps:
- Load and preprocess the image dataset
- Train the image classifier on your dataset
- Use the trained classifier to predict image content

Data Set: We'll be using this dataset of 102 flower categories: http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html.

Techniques:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- PyTorch
- VGG16
- DenseNet201
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss Function: NLLLoss
