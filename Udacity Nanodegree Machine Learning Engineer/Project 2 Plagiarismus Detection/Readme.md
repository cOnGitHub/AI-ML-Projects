Project: Plagiarismus Detection (Notebook 2: Feature Engineering, Notebook 3: Model Training)

Course: Udacity Nanodegree Machine Learning

Project submission: 14.12.2020

## Jupyter Notebook 2 Plagiarismus Detection, Feature Engineering
Notebook Outline:

- Clean and pre-process the data.
- Define features for comparing the similarity of an answer text and a source text, and extract similarity features.
- Select "good" features, by analyzing the correlations between different features.
- Create train/test .csv files that hold the relevant features and class labels for train/test data points.

Data Set: Data Set slightly modified from Clough, P. and Stevenson, M. Developing A Corpus of Plagiarised Short Answers, Language Resources and Evaluation: Special Issue on Plagiarism and Authorship Analysis, In Press
